# In the Dark
Scenario for Valkyrie and Mansions of Madness, 2 edition

CHANGES DONE 1

1. Asking about the Ritual
Made slightly more random.
The order now goes:
	Not Role 1 decided by pre-shuffle of the roles
	Not Role 3 decided by pre-shuffle of the roles
	Not Role 4 decided by pre-shuffle of the roles
	Then random of
		Two thirds chance of Not Role 1 again
		One third chance of Not Role 4 again

2. Giving Sigil to Role 1
Calls up EventEliminated so will use the same image

3. Initialisation for 5 Investigators
Added for game balance.

4. Close Friend Text added for asking about Role 3
If an Ally is asked about Ally Role 3 they will reveal the Ally was a close friend of Martha.  For roles 1 and 2, this may be a lie.  Once done, a flag is raised so that the text is not repeated.

5. Darkness Tokens
Darkness Tokens cover all spaces of a tile.
Text added to Scenario and to the placement of tiles.

6. Cellar Crate
Added test for the searching of the crate

7. Ghost of Bettina
Fixed reference to husband and step-sister.


CHANGES DONE 2

1. Painting
Incremented countSigil for all events triggered by solving the painting.

2. Give Sigil to Role 2
Redid the text so the Druid grabs the sigil and drops it.

3. EventPlaceRitualSite
Added a repeat of WhoHasDagger,=,#rand3 as currently the randomizer seems to favour the number 1 when Valkyrie is run for the first time.

4. Camp Fire
The camp fire goes out at the end of the MajorMythosRound.
This can have a significant effect on the finale.

5. Spawned Dark Young at Graveyard
Monster spawned in the rightmost space.

6. Simplified the Dark Young Retreat
[EventDarkYoungRetreat]
Text is simplified and the question reversed.
